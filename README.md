# How cool is my research?

Experiment on coolness. Feel free to [send me](http://samuelcroset.com/contact) feedback and comments.

## Method

### Graph

Each dot represents the standardised frequency of documents retrieved for the keywords entered on PubMed, multiplied by 1'000; the higher, the more articles exists on the topic.

### Coolness

A search with a standadised frequency increasing in the last 10 years:

`t(now) - t(now - 10 years) > 0 -> cool`.

### Other methods

PubMed provides the evolution of the number of documents per year, yet the information is not standardised. As the total number of indexed articles almost tripled in 20 years ([1983](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1983%2F01%2F01%3A1983%2F12%2F31%5Bedat%5D) - [2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2012%2F01%2F01%3A2012%2F12%2F31%5Bedat%5D)), it is important to weight the data accordingly.
