# How cool is my research?

Experiment on coolness. Feel free to [send me](http://samuelcroset.com/contact) feedback and comments.

## Method

- **Graph**: Each dot represents the standardised frequency of documents retrieved for the keywords entered on PubMed; the higher, the more articles exists on the topic.

- **Coolness**: A search with a standadised frequency increasing in the last 10 years: `t(now) - t(now - 10 years) > 0 -> cool`.
